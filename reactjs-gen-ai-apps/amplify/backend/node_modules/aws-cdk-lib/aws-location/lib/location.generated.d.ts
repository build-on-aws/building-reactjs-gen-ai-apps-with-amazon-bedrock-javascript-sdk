         * - `VectorEsriLightGrayCanvas` – The Esri Light Gray Canvas map style, which provides a detailed vector basemap with a light gray, neutral background style with minimal colors, labels, and features that's designed to draw attention to your thematic content.
         * - `VectorEsriTopographic` – The Esri Light map style, which provides a detailed vector basemap with a classic Esri map style.
         * - `VectorEsriStreets` – The Esri World Streets map style, which provides a detailed vector basemap for the world symbolized with a classic Esri street map style. The vector tile layer is similar in content and style to the World Street Map raster map.

         * - `VectorHereExploreTruck` – A global map containing truck restrictions and attributes (e.g. width / height / HAZMAT) symbolized with highlighted segments and icons on top of HERE Explore to support use cases within transport and logistics.
         * - `RasterHereExploreSatellite` – A global map containing high resolution satellite imagery.
         * - `HybridHereExploreSatellite` – A global map displaying the road network, street names, and city labels over satellite imagery. This style will automatically retrieve both raster and vector tiles, and your charges will be based on total tiles retrieved.
         *
         * > Hybrid styles use both vector and raster tiles when rendering the map that you see. This means that more tiles are retrieved than when using either vector or raster tiles alone. Your charges will include all tiles retrieved.
